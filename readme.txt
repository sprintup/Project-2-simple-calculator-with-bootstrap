# For this project you will: 
- [x] build a one-page website using Visual Studio and ASP.NET that
- [x] allows the user to perform some kind of calculation using three input fields, and one output field that
- [x] uses Bootstrap as the responsive frame work. Use the example on page 79 of your textbook as visual reference.

- [x] Two of the fields should accept whole numbers up to four digits long (ie: 9999) and
- [x] perform a validation on the input if out of range, text characters or decimal values are submitted.
- [x] The third field should ask for the person’s name.

When a button is clicked,
- [x] the calculation should be performed, and
- [x] the output displayed somewhere on the page in a sentence that says something similar like “Hi <name>, your answer is: “ and the answer.
- [x] Include a functional "clear" button.

- [x] Add some custom stylings including fonts, font colors, backgrounds, etc.

- [x] Your html should use the semantic elements discussed previously, and
- [x] your images should use meaningful alt tags

- [x] Create a custom logo.

- [x] Test your project in at least two browsers, one of which should be Google Chrome.

# What to submit: 
- [x] Link to your repo. Your repo should contain the complete Visual Studio solution including images, bootstrap files.
