* For this project you will: *
[X] build a one-page website using Visual Studio and ASP.NET that
[X] allows the user to perform some kind of calculation using three input fields, and one output field that
[ ] uses Bootstrap as the responsive frame work. Use the example on page 79 of your textbook as visual reference.

[ ] Two of the fields should accept whole numbers up to four digits long (ie: 9999) and
[ ] perform a validation on the input if out of range, text characters or decimal values are submitted.
[ ] The third field should ask for the person’s name.

When a button is clicked,
[X] the calculation should be performed, and
[ ] the output displayed somewhere on the page in a sentence that says something similar like “Hi <name>, your answer is: “ and the answer.
[ ] Include a functional "clear" button.

[ ] Add some custom stylings including fonts, font colors, backgrounds, etc.

[ ] Your html should use the semantic elements discussed previously, and
[ ] your images should use meaningful alt tags

[ ] Create a custom logo.

[ ] Test your project in at least two browsers, one of which should be Google Chrome.

* What to submit: *
[ ] Link to your repo. Your repo should contain the complete Visual Studio solution including images, bootstrap files.
